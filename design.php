    <p class="para">
        The quality of an application's user experience typically determines how good or poor its design is. If an application is well-organized, functional, and visually appealing, it will load quickly, be simple to use, and increase user happiness.
        For senior system architects who are prepared to assume the post of Pega Certified Lead System Architect (PCLSA), the Application Design mission is advanced.
        Our goal is to provide you with modules and topics that will assist you in creating an efficient case structure, applying solutions for specialized applications to support constantly changing requirements, packaging assets to encourage efficient reuse, and converting an existing application into a blueprint, framework, model, or application without requiring the classes of existing case type instances to be renamed.
